# Deep Learning Specialization

Deep Learning is transforming multiple industries. This five-course specialization will help you understand Deep Learning fundamentals, apply them, and build a career in AI.

  - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  - **Improving Deep Neural Networks**
  - Structuring Machine Learning Projects
  - Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Sequence Models

# Course 2 - Improving Deep Neural Networks!

This course will teach you the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. Rather than the deep learning process being a black box, you will understand what drives performance, and be able to more systematically get good results. You will also learn TensorFlow. 

After 3 weeks, you will: 
- Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications. 
- Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking, 
- Be able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence. 
- Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
- Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow. 

This is the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization.
